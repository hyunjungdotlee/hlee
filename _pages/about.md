I am a PhD candidate in the [IGRA graduate programme](https://www.philol.uni-leipzig.de/graduiertenkolleg-interaktion-grammatischer-bausteine) at the Universität Leipzig. My primary linguistic interest lies in exploring structures and constraints that underlie sentence formation within generative grammar. My dissertation focuses on syntactic movement in ditransitive constructions and investigates the A/A-bar asymmetries within these structures.  I am also affiliated witt DFG Scientific Network [Applicative alternations across languages (AAAL)](https://aaal.uni-koeln.de/). I also work on natural language processing projects. 



Research Interests
------
* Movement (Asymmetries in Left- & Rightward Movements, Scrambling, Extraposition)
* (No) Control and its licensing condition (with Mike Berger)
* Locality Constraint on Suppletive Allomorph  (with Irene Amato)
* Natural Language Processing (with Guanghao Xu)

Apart from my interests in Linguistics,

I am also passionate about fighting racism (especially anti-Asian racism in Europe) and sexism, organizing women's empowerment workshops, and facilitating structural discourse on these issues.
